# The Cardassian Game of Strategy
## UQCS Hackathon 2024
_Isaac Toombes, Team Qo'nos_

## About
Kotra, one of the greatest games of the Cardassian Union, and a true monument to its stategic might, is finally available on your local datapad, ship's computer, and holosuite!

Play as one of two Guls, battling your fleet -- these are no battleships, but true WARSHIPS.
At your disposal, you have:
 - 2 Kelor-class Destroyers
 - 4 Galor-class Cruisers
 - 4 Ravinok-type Freighters
 - 
Position them in your 8x5x8 sector grid, and engage your opponent in brilliant combat.

## Installation
Import into your Unix distro and execute the Makefile.
This has been built on the UQ EAIT Moss server, but there are no guarantees that it'll run on your machine.

## How to play
Kotra is a game for two players. One player hosts.

So far, nothing has been implemented.
'''
kotra -h [port] : Host a Kotra game. If no port is provided, hosts on a random port.
kotra -j <port> : Join a game on provided port.
kotra           : Play against computer.
